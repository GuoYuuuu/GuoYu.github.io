excerpt: 'The research of the flight procedure evaluation is essential for ensuring flight safety. With Daocheng Yading Airport as the research object, combined with its Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data, a flight procedure evaluation method, namely Analytic Hierarchy Process, Entropy Weight Method, and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (AHP-EWM-TOPSIS), was proposed in this paper. The process specifically includes: firstly, a secondary index system is built and optimized by Delphi research; secondly, according to results of the investigation and QAR data of Daocheng Yading Airport, index weights are determined by the combination of AHP and EWM; again, the comprehensive evaluation of the model is completed by TOPSIS; finally, the evaluation of actual samples is applied to analyze the model. Results show that the method proposed in this paper has a certain degree of effectiveness and feasibility for practice.'
