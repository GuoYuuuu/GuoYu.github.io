excerpt: 'Flight trajectory data, collected through devices like Quick Access Recorders (QAR), is essential for ensuring flight safety and performance analysis. However, due to inherent uncertainties and noise during flight, this data requires filtering to reduce noise impact. The traditional Kalman filtering algorithm, commonly used in civil aviation for QAR data processing, faces limitations when dealing with uncertain noise values across different aircraft types and flight phases. This study explores the application of adaptive Kalman filtering to enhance the accuracy and stability of flight trajectory filtering. Unlike traditional methods, adaptive Kalman filtering dynamically adjusts parameters based on actual data, improving its adaptability to various noise characteristics and enhancing data quality. A comparative analysis with segmented noise matrix adjustment methods highlights the advantages of the adaptive approach, demonstrating its effectiveness through the three-dimensional trajectory analysis on QAR data. The findings indicate that adaptive Kalman filtering not only preserves essential data characteristics but also simplifies the filtering process, making it a valuable tool for QAR data processing and flight trajectory analysis with broad applicability and significant practical value.'
